savvily and, `updated-xml-data.xml`.

Use `make update-xml` for update data from feed, it's saved on
`data/updated-xml-data.xml`. The code takes the xml data and saves all episodes
inside one markdown file, parsing html description into markdown. The output is
on `/data`.

Copy podcast folder from savvily repository into `/data` and execute the code
using docker or the actual machine. This will take all files and parse the
